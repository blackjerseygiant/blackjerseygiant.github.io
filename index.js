          <h2>ìÜù ìÜü ìÜû</h2>
          <p>I first discovered the poet Monica Sok when I was fourteen.</p>
          <p>At the time, Loung Ung (<i>First They Killed My Father</i>) and Vaddey Ratner 
          (<i>In the Shadow of the Banyan</i>) were the only Cambodian authors that I knew of. 
          Almost everything else I came across from the diaspora was centered on genocide. Make no mistake: 
          this literature is essential. As a pre-teen, I devoured every Cambodian genocide memoir or novel 
          I could find at my local library, seeking answers to the questions I was too afraid to ask my own parents. 
          But at some point, the weight of these emotions‚Äîshaped by my parents‚Äô survival, our losses, and what 
          I inherited‚Äîgrew too heavy to hold. I needed to understand of the rest of my world.</p>
          <p>When I first googled "cambodian american poet," I was desperate to find someone like me, a 
          child of genocide survivors, who could help me make sense of the joy and grief and loss and guilt and nostalgia 
          that I carried.  Monica Sok was the first, and at the time, the only writer I found, but possibly the 
          most impactful to me since. Here I was, alone in my bedroom, reading words that I swore were taken 
          from my own life too:
          </p>
          <p>
          "I want to know the names of things, <br>
          only the names in Khmer. <br>
          I want to know the names of trees <br>
          whose roots grow on temple roofs. <br><br>

          I don't want to know my uncle was never found. <br>
          When my aunts looked for his face, his was not there. <br>
          [‚Ä¶]"
          <br><br>
          ‚Äî"Yearning", <i>Year Zero</i>
          </p>
          <p> * </p>
          <p>
          I will never be able to fully articulate the emotion I felt upon realizing that a writer before me 
          carried this pain too, yet still moved tenderly through her life. Since then, I‚Äôve been fortunate to 
          find other Cambodian-American writers over the past decade. I‚Äôm in awe of our community and excited 
          for the stories, novels, poems, and art we will continue to share with each other and the world. 
          If you found this page by googling ‚ÄúCambodian-American poets‚Äù or ‚ÄúCambodian-American writers,‚Äù 
          I hope this list helps you discover more voices, just as I did.
          </p>
